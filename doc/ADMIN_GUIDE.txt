ASSUMPTIONS
    - you are a RHCE (or equivalent in a Unix environment)
    - you are installing on Fedora 14,16 or Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6.*


OVERVIEW
    - PFP offers BRMS administrators & developers the following :
      1)  this document which outlines the entire provisioning process of one example of a production BRMS deployable environment
        - NOTE:  the tasks outlined in this document are written in sequential order
        - subsequently, it's best to start at the beginning of this document and progress in the order this doc is written
        - this document includes the following chapters:
            1)  ASSUMPTIONS
            2)  OVERVIEW
            3)  INSTALL
            4)  POST INSTALL ADMINISTRATION

      2)  an ant script which is executed as part of this BRMS deployable provisioning
        - what does the ant script do ?
            - once Apache Ant 1.8.3 has been installed (as outlined below in this document), 
              you'll be able to view a description of the various ant targets by executing from the root of this project:   ant -p
        - how is the ant script executed ?
            - there is a section towards the latter part of this document entitled:  "deploy BRMS runtime artifacts to JBoss EAP"
            - if provisioning a new BRMS environment, then this section explains the how to execute the ant script to do that
            - please ensure all of the previous steps outlined in this document have been completed prior to executing the ant script



INSTALL   :
    -- NOTE:  almost all of the following tasks can (and should probably be) automated via a kickstart provisioning script

    -- networking
        -- HOSTNAME
            -- ensure that target OS has a hostname (preferrably with relevance to this jbpm5 project) that is not 'localhost' or 'localhost.localdomain'
            -- a permanent change to the hostname of the operating system can be conducted as follows :
                    (as root) :  modify value of 'HOSTNAME' in :   vi /etc/sysconfig/network
                             init 6 (bounce the operating system)
        -- mapping in /etc/hosts
                -- ensure that the OS hostname is correctly mapped to the ethernet interface 
                    (as root) :  modify /etc/hosts such that it has entries similar to the following (example assumes 'fedora14-jbpm5' is OS hostname):

                        192.168.122.10  fedora14-jbpm5

        NOTE:  often times, the OS hostname will already be mapped to the localhost interface.  
            It is important to remove that mapping and ensure that only the mapping between the OS hostname and the ethernet NIC exists



    -- Red Hat Network (RHN)
        NOTE:  this section is only applicable if environment to be built is either on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5.* or 6.*

        -- RHN registration
                -- set web proxy for rhn_register
                    -- (as root)    vi /etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date
                                        enableProxy=1
                                        httpProxy=http://<my.proxy.url>:8080
                -- (as root) :     rhn_register

        --  RHN channel modifications
                -- after system registration is complete, open any browser (from any computer) and log into http://rhn.redhat.com
                -- select your system and then click 'Alter Channel Subscriptions".  Select the following channels and click 'change subscriptions'
                    Base Channel
                        * Red Hat Enterprise Linux (v. 5 for 64-bit x86_64)

                -- logout of Red Hat Network
                -- NOTE:  this can be done programmatically.  Example as follows :
                     yum install rhn-setup.noarch"  # to install rhn-channel
                     rhn-channel -u SteveMarney -p <my passwd> -a jb-ewp-5-x86_64-server-5-rpm 
                     rhn-channel -u SteveMarney -p <my passwd> -a rhel-x86_64-server-supplementary-5

        -- enable RHN Plugin
                -- it is possible that the access to the RHN repository is disabled.
                -- a disbled RHN repository becomes evident when executing 'yum update' and only the 'security' plugin appears enabled
                -- enable the RHN plugin in the following file :
                    /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/rhnplugin.conf



    -- Java Development Kit
            -- ensure that either OpenJDK or Sun JDK 1.6 is installed
                (as root) :     yum install java-1.6.0-openjdk
                                yum install java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel
                        or
                                yum install java-1.6.0-sun
                                yum install java-1.6.0-sun-devel



    -- 'jboss' operating system user
            - there are some processFlowProvision steps that require root privledges.
            - the majority of steps should NOT be executed as root.
            - instead, processFlowProvision assumes an operating system user called 'jboss' that has non-root privledges
            (as root) : useradd -u 600 -g 100 -d /home/jboss -m -s /bin/bash jboss
            (as root) : passwd jboss




    --  $JBOSS_PROJECTS directory
            -- make a 'jbossProjects' directory and have it owned by jboss:jboss
                (as root) :     mkdir -p /opt/jbossProjects/jboss
                                mkdir /opt/jbossProjects/downloads
                                chown -R jboss:100 /opt/jbossProjects

    --  git and wget
        (as root)   :   yum install git wget


    --  required PFP shell environment variables
      - processFlowProvision is reliant on the following shell environment variables :
          JBOSS_HOME        :   location of JBoss EAP
          PFP_HOME          :   location of process flow provision project
          JBOSS_PROJECTS    :   default location of PFP service task repository and guvnor filesystem
          HORNETQ_HOME      :   location of hornetq distribution
      - these environment variables are set via the standard ~/.bashrc
      - processFlowProvision maintains a template bashrc
      - execute the following to copy the template bashrc to the 'jboss' users home directory :
            (as jboss):     cd /opt/jbossProjects/processFlowProvision
                            cp ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.bak
                            cp conf/shell/bashrc ~/.bashrc
                            cp conf/git/git_completion ~/.git_completion
                            ( review the newly copied ~/.bashrc and modify where appropriate )
                            source ~/.bashrc

                                
      --  firewall configuration
            -- this processFlowProvision project currently disables the  operating system firewall.  Please do so as follows :
                (as root) :     chkconfig --level 2345 iptables off
                                service iptables stop
            -- if the decision is ever made to enable the operating system firewall, this project does include a sample modified iptables config file
            -- this sample iptables includes modifications to allow for Tomcat, HornetQ, PostgreSQL and JNP traffic
                (as root) :     cp /etc/sysconfig/iptables /etc/sysconfig/iptables.bak 
                                cp /opt/jbossProjects/processFlowProvision/conf/iptables/iptables /etc/sysconfig

            -- subsequently, Ant will need to be configured to route internet requests through a web proxy if build environment is behind a corporate firewall
            -- the 'ANT_OPTS' environment variable, such as the following, is used to configuring networking for Ant :

    HornetQ queues
        -- upon start-up of JBossEAP, several queues will be created in the local HornetQ messaging provider
        -- newly created HornetQ objects can be inspected on a running HornetQ environment via the jdk 'jconsole' utility
        -- (as jboss)    :   jconsole --> New Connection dialogue box should appear --> 'org.hornetq.integration.bootstrap.HornetQBootstrap' process --> connect
                             MBeans --> org.hornetq --> Queue --> Core

           the following queues should be avaliable :
            -  jms.queue.DLQ                                    :   not currently used

modifications to runtime directory structure
  - $JBOSS_HOME/server/default-${organization.name}             
        - PFP enabled JBoss runtime
        - created with execution of 'ant' from $JBOSS_PROJECTS/processFlowProvision
        - new directory is cloned from $JBOSS_HOME/server/default and then modified with BRMS and PFP enhancements


  - $JBOSS_HOME/server/default-${organization.name}/deploy/${organization.name}
        - hot deployable runtime directory with most BRMS and PFP artifacts

  
  - $JBOSS_HOME/server/default-${organization.name}/deploy/properties-service.xml
        - MBean that registers various BRMS and PFP system properties


  - $JBOSS_HOME/server/default-${organization.name}/lib/${organization.name}
        - location of all BRMS and PFP static libraries
        - JBoss adds these static libraries to its unifiedclassloader where these classes are accessible by all runtime artifacts





Guvnor Configurations
    1) background :
        - Guvnor 'packages' are created in Guvnor as per: http://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/5.4.0.CR1/drools-guvnor-docs/html_single/index.html#d0e361
        - in PFP, the KnowledgeSessionService is a client to Drools Guvnor
        - a single instance of a Drools KnowledgeBase is managed by the PFP KnowledgeSessionService
        - other components in PFP, such as the gwt-console-server, use the knowledgeSessionService as a proxy to Guvnor
        - the knowledgeSessionService needs to be explicity configured to query for your specific packages in Guvnor
        - for example, if you've created (or intend to create) a Guvnor package called:  org.my.package
          then, the the knowledgeSessionService needs to be configured to query guvnor using the package name as a key:  org.my.package
        - configuring the knowledgeSessionService is done via the guvnor.packages property as described below

    2) guvnor.packages property
        - please pay particular attention to the following property in $PFP_HOME/build.properties:  guvnor.packages   
        - this is a comma seperated list of guvnor packages that the PFP KnowledgeSessionService will use to query Guvnor to build the Drools knowledgeBase
        - please configure this property with a list of one or more of your Guvnor packages
        - once a change to this property is made, please execute the following :
            1)  ensure the JBoss EAP on that machine is shutdown
            2)  from the root of PFP, execute :   ant
            3)  restart JBoss EAP specifying the default-${organizational.name} configuration
        - these instructions super-cede similar instructions provided in Chapter 16 of the jbpm5 User Guide:  Process Repository

    3)  printKnowledgeBaseContent() helper function
        - the PFP IKnowledgeSessionService interface exposes a function called:  printKnowledgeBaseContent()
        - the purpose of this function is to view which packages (and the process definitions of each package) that the 
          knowledgeSessionService's knowledgeBase is aware of
        - this function can be invoked remotely by an EJB client or via the JBoss EAP jmx-console

Work Item Handlers in ProcessFlowProvision
    in jbpm5, there are both bpmn2 editor and runtime considerations when working with work item handlers
    bpmn2 editor considerations as follows :
        1)  the procedure for defining Service Tasks is the same whether using the jbpm5 web "Designer" or legacy Eclipse Drools-Flow Plugin
        2)  defining Service Tasks
            -- please see the following section of the jbpm5 User Guide:  6.5.2 Service Task
        3)  private Service Task Repositories
            - please see :   processFlowProvision/privateServiceTaskRepo/README.txt


    runtime considerations as follows :
        -- Creating & configuring custom work item handlers in processFlowProvision is almost identical to creating custom work item handlers in stock BRMS
        -- Background Documentation :       12.1.3  Registering your own service handlers
        -- The following are a few processFlowProvision additions :

        1)  programmatically registered work item handlers
          -- every StatefulKnowledgeSession managed by the processFlowProvision knowledgeSessionService is automatically registered with
           the following workItemHandlers :
            1)  "Human Task"    :   org.jboss.processFlow.tasks.WSHumanTaskHandler
            2)  "Skip Task"     :   org.jboss.processFlow.tasks.PFPSkipTaskHandler
            3)  "Fail Task"     :   org.jboss.processFlow.tasks.PFPFailTaskHandler
            4)  "Email"         :   org.jboss.processFlow.tasks.PFPEmailWorkItemHandler


        2)  defining configurable work item handlers
          -- jbpm5 allows for more than one META-INF/drools.session.conf in the runtime classpath 
            -- subsequently, there is the potential for mulitple locations that define custom work item handlers
          -- the abiity to have multiple META-INF/drools.session.conf files on the runtime classpath most likely will lead to 
                 increased difficulty isolating problems encountered with defining and registering custom work item handlers
          -- processFlowProvision/build.properties includes the following property:  space.delimited.workItemHandler.configs
          -- rather than allowing for multiple locations to define custom work item handlers, 
                use of the 'space.delimited.workItemHandler.configs' property centralalizes where to define additional custom workItemHandlers 
          -- please see documentation provided for that property in the build.properties


        3)  org.jboss.processFlow.knowledgeService.IKnowledgeSessionService.printWorkItemHandlers()
          -- helper function to troubleshoot runtime configuration and classpath issues regarding custom work item handlers
          -- please see the javadocs for the 'printWorkItemHandlers' function for IKnowledgeSessionService



deploy-time customizations to PFP EJB services
  - all PFP services are deployed in the JBOSS deploy directory as exploded jars
  - this allows for easy accessibility to the EJB (and JBoss extension) descriptor files at deploy time 


Task Validation in PFP
    - jbpm5 allows for use of a org.jbpm.task.service.UserGroupCallback implementation to determine :
        - boolean existsUser(String userId);
        - boolean existsGroup(String groupId);
        - List<String> getGroupsForUser(String userId, List<String> groupIds, List<String> allExistingGroupIds)
    - when enabled, this UserGroupCallback functionality will automatically load non-existent users and groups into the OrganizationEntity table
    - doing so avoids the need for loading of legacy LoadUsers.mvel and LoadGroups.mvel while at the same time ensuring referential integrity
        of the task database is maintained
    - in PFP, we do enable the UserGroupCallback functionality of jbpm5 and implement a simplistic:  org.jboss.processFlow.tasks.PFPUserGroupCallback
    - the purpose of enabling the UserGroupCallback functionality in PFP is simply to avoid having to pre-load Users and Groups into the OrganizationEntity table
    - log statement when org.jbpm.task.identity.UserGroupCallbackManager detects jbpm.usergroup.callback properties file on classpath will be :
        UserGroupCallback registered from properties file: org.jboss.processFlow.tasks.PFPUserGroupCallback

    - in PFP, actual task validation can occur (where/when needed on a customer basis) in the EJB3 tier
    - delegating security to the EJB3 tier provides PFP with the following :
        1)  a standards based security implementation across all PFP functionality :  knowledgeSessionService, taskService and bamService


asynch messaging in PFP
    - there is lots of confusion as to where and why PFP leverages asynch messaging 
    - the $PFP_HOME/README.txt briefly discusses where messaging is used ... but hopefully this paragraph clarifies further
    - where messaging is NOT used in PFP :
        - jbpm5 includes various "transport" implementations for human task lifecycle management
        - possible "transport" implementations include Mina, Hornetq Core, JMS and "Local"
        - PFP does not use any of the above "transport" implementations for human task lifecycle management
        - instead, PFP exposes a Human Task API based on EJB3
        - the implementation of this PFP Human Task API leverages the jbpm5 TaskServiceSession directly and in that sense is very similar
            to the new "Local" implementation provided by jbpm5
        - PFP currently does not leverage the "Local" implementation only because our implementation pre-dates the newer "Local" implementation
        - on our TO-DO list, is to still expose the same EJB3 based Human Task API but leverage the jbpm5 "Local" implementation internally
        - but back to why PFP does NOT use a messaging provider as the transport for Human Task lifecycle management ....
            1)  single-threaded
                - both the jbpm5 Hornetq Core and JMS Task Server implementations are single-threaded
                - neither is implemented as an MDB and there is no thread management in either of these Task Servers that would allow for concurrency
                - so our performance tests have highlighted that both of these Task Server implementations quickly becomes a performance bottleneck
            2)  complex
                - the jbpm5 Hornetq Core and JMS Task implementations are too complex for our needs
                - sometimes complexity is needed, but in this case the added de-bugging/administraton of these implementations has been too costly

    - where messaging IS used in PFP :
        - as per the jbpm5 ProcessEventListener interface, the jbpm5 process engine can fire events at various stages in the lifecycle of a process instance
        - one ProcessEventListener implementation that can be registered with the jbpm5 process engine is PFP's:  org.jboss.processFlow.bam.AsyncBAMProducer
        - as the name implies, this ProcessEventListener implementation fires events with process instance data that will subsequently be used to populate
            a BAM database
        - the jbpm5 base product has a similar ProcessEventListener implementation that also populates a BAM database with process instance data
        - the difference between the two implementations, however, is that the org.jboss.processFlow.bam.AsyncBAMProducer sends these BAM events to 
            an asynch messaging provider (either Hornetq or RH-M) rather than inserting BAM events immediately into a RDBMS
        - the reason for this async BAM approach is performance
            - with BAM reporting turned off, the core jbpm5 process engine is lightning fast and stable
            - PFP attempts to limit performance degradation of the jbpm5 process engine while still supporting BAM reporting
            - the journalling file system of either Hornetq or RH-M can be significantly faster than a RDBMS ... subsequently PFP sends its 
                BAM events to a messaging broker
            - PFP implements a BAMService MDB that ultimately consumes BAM events and inserts into a different BAM data wharehouse in batch
